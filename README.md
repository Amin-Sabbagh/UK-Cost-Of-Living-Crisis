# COST OF LIVING IN THE UK: INSIGHTS VIA AI, DATA VISUALIZATION, AND STORYTELLING

Welcome to the repository for my thesis project, "Cost of Living in the UK: Insights via AI, Data Visualization, and Storytelling." This project explores the multifaceted aspects of the cost-of-living crisis in the UK using  data analysis techniques in python, machine learning models, and compelling data visualizations. I recieved a 1st in this project.

## Overview

The cost-of-living crisis is a pressing issue affecting many households across the UK. This thesis aims to analyze and interpret the factors contributing to this crisis through comprehensive data analysis and visualization. By leveraging machine learning and data storytelling, the project provides insightful and actionable perspectives on the economic challenges faced by individuals and families.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Sources**: Utilised  datasets from governmental organisations.
- **Cleaning**: Implemented data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Transformation**: Applied normalization and scaling methods to prepare data for analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed hypothesis testing and regression analysis to identify key factors impacting the cost of living.


### 3. Data Visualization

- **Visualization Tools**: Utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating interactive and informative visualizations.

### 5. Storytelling

- **Narrative Construction**: Crafted a compelling narrative to present the findings, emphasizing the human impact of the cost-of-living crisis.


## Skills Gained

- **Data Science Skills**: Developed a strong foundation in data science, including data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Enhanced my ability to think critically and analytically about complex problems.
- **Machine Learning**: Gained hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Data Visualization**: Mastered the art of creating insightful and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations.
- **Communication**: Improved my ability to communicate technical findings to a non-technical audience through storytelling and visualization.


## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the cost-of-living crisis in the UK through the lens of data science and machine learning via python. By presenting the findings through data visualization and storytelling, it aims to make complex data accessible and engaging to a wider audience.
